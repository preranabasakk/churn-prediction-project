# 🔄 Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using supervised machine learning. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to discontinue a service based on various features such as demographic details, usage patterns, and payment behavior.

---

## 🎯 Objective

To develop and train a machine learning model using Python that can accurately predict whether a customer will churn. This is essential for businesses aiming to improve customer retention strategies and minimize revenue loss.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Language**: Python 3.x
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook
- **Libraries**:  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` – data manipulation  
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn` – data visualization  
  - `scikit-learn` – machine learning  
  - `joblib` – model serialization

## 🔍 Workflow Summary

### 1. 📊 Data Preprocessing
- Missing value handling
- Encoding of categorical variables
- Conversion of `TotalCharges` to numeric
- Dropping unnecessary columns like `customerID`

### 2. 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visual analysis to understand feature relationships
- Correlation heatmap
- Distribution plots and churn trends

### 3. 🧠 Model Training
- Splitting into train and test sets
- Training a Logistic Regression classifier
- Model evaluation using classification report and confusion matrix

### 4. 💾 Model Saving
- The trained model is saved as `churn_model.pkl` using `joblib`

## 🚀 Future Improvements
✅ Add support for multiple classification models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost)

🌐 Deploy model using Streamlit or Flask web app

📊 Add feature importance and model explainability tools (like SHAP or LIME)
